I began to implement some of the shapes, Earlier you mentioned a complete redo of the way our enviorment was going to be implemented.

For this reason I don't feel it wise to set up proper calls to each shape until then.

This should be considered drop-in code however I "dropped" it into the main code so you could have any idea of how it will work.

There are still some bugs to work out, you can see if you care to by running main gui and events I think the problem is with make-perfect and the line appears to be acting wonky but I havnt looked into that yet.

I have also  updated gui and events, I changed buttons to trigger proper events
