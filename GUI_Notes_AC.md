## GUI Layout

Going to place a few layout designs on here. I added a couple already but I'll make a few more and we can decide which one to base 
our GUI off of. I'll make an electronic version of one or two as well; we could possibly put one in the fp4 proposal or on a slide for the 
project proposal.

####Layout(a, b)

####Layout(c, d)

These two layouts are currently the ones I like the most, and I'm experimenting with creating the layout in racket based on these at the moment.

### Thoughts/Ideas:
 -Maybe have a button that cycles through a list of colors.
